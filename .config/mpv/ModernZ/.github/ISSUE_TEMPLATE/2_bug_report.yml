      description: >
          Try to reproduce your issue with `--no-config` and mpv's stock osc first. If it is reproducible
          even then, try to find out which option or script causes your issue.


          Describe the reproduction steps as precise as possible. It's very likely that
          the bug you experience wasn't reproduced by the developer because the workflow
          differs from your own.

          Make a log file with `--log-file=output.txt` and

          If you have trouble producing a log file, you can alternatively use `-v -v`,
          save the terminal output to a file, and attach it to the issue.
